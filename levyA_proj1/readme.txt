levyA_proj1.py

Run through command prompt with the command: py levyA_proj1.py

When the program is run, the user will be prompted to input two positive integers in two seperate statements.
If the user does not input a positve integer for either of the two inputs then they will prompted once again
two input to positive integers. If the user fails to type valid inputs three seperate times then the program will end
and say "goodbye!". No test will be done and no results will be displayed. If the user provides valid inputs then
the program will run all the way through and return the time it took to run each algorithm as well as the GCD found
by each one, which should be equal for all algorithms.
