levyA_proj2.py

Run through command prompt with the command: py levyA_proj2.py

The program will read a set of points through the input text file named 'input.txt'. This text file can be adjusted to test different points.
The program returns the time of each of the two algorithms run as well as the shortest distance that each algorithm calculated 
(which both algorithms should be the same). Test cases and time efficiencies for algorithms can be found in proffesional report.

I conducted my experiment by running two algorithms given the same input and then timing each algorithm to see which one ran the fastest. I 
did this by measuring the runtime time before and after each algorithm and subtracting them to get the runtime of the algorithm. 

The most efficient algorithm for time efficiency is the Divide and Conquer Method. The running time of this algorithm is linearithmic so it 
is faster than the brute force method, which is quadratic. This is proved in the runtime data. The Divide and Conquer method has the fastest 
runtime in 75% of test cases. When the amount of points is very small, brute force is more efficient. However, as the number of points 
increases, brute force takes more time and divide and conquer becomes more time efficient.

Test Cases were performed as well.
